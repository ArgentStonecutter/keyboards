Replacing switches is like building the world's most boring Lego model. The keyboard should come with a tool that's got a key cap remover on one end and a switch remover on the other. Or it might have them in separate tools, but any hot swap keyboard will come with the tools unless the manufacturer is a total jerk.

Before you start put the keyboard into a lighting mode where the light comes on when you hit the key, this will be useful later. This mode may be called heat map or reactive or something like that.

Anyway you use the keycap removal tool to remove the key caps and I would have a place to line them up so that you can easily put them back where they came from, then you use the switch removal tool to grab the switches at the top and the bottom where there are these little flimsy latches, so be a little gentle with them. And then you pull them out maybe rocking them back and forth a little if they are recalcitrant.

Then when you want to put new switches in: line them up and push them gently in using the stem on top so when they are lined up right the lights come on and that lets you know that it's safe to push them the rest of the way home and lock them in place, that way you're not pushing in with a bent pin and potentially damaging the socket.
