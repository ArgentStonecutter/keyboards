[^*]: Emulated QMK - proprietary firmware with a VIA port.

[^†]: I know, Royal Kludge, Redragon. I got the Redragon R717 Alcor and I tried out the Royal Kludge RK R65 for a few days and it's OK.

[^**]: This is actually a good board, but you have to reprogram all the layers because they have built a whopping great 15-layer Heath-Robinson emulation of the terrible old legacy model's loony-tunes layout.

[^††]: These are sold as bare PCBs, sometimes with plates and cases and sometimes without, you're on your own for stabs and foam and batteries and the like.

[^‡]: Sold as a kit, you build the case from Lego style bricks. Minila layout.

[^♪♪]: Untested and unreviewed.
