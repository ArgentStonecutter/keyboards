[^*]: Emulated QMK - proprietary firmware with a VIA port.

[^†]: I know, Royal Kludge, Redragon. I got the Redragon R717 Alcor and I tried out the Royal Kludge RK R65 for a few days and it's OK.

[^**]: This is actually a good board, but you have to reprogram all the layers because they have built a whopping great 15-layer Heath-Robinson emulation of the terrible old legacy model's loony-tunes layout.

[^††]: These are sold as bare PCBs, sometimes with plates and cases and sometimes without, you're on your own for stabs and foam and batteries and the like.

[^‡]: Sold as a kit, you build the case from Lego style bricks. Minila layout.

[^♪♪]: Legitimately QMK. But. 63 key layout that's like a half-assed minila. It has arrow keys like a Minila but it keeps the wider left shift and moves the slash key right to the edge. Only get it if you don't think this will drive you crazy.

[^♫]: QMK/VIA but it needs a 2u left spacebar and there are very few keycap sets that have that.

[^㊍]: Wooden case, and possibly the best commercially available wooden board despite the tray mount and ugly default keycaps.

[^+]: JSON file under "jamesdonkey/j2" directory.

[^?]: Report of poor customer support.

[^#]: 52 keys, 12u wide like a typical 40% but with a number row.

[^Z]: Newer versions of the firmware with audio lighting controls are not VIA compatible. Should I remove this one?

[^G]: Source code available for download at https://glencreag.com/products/wk84-wired-wooden-mechanical-keyboard.

[^K]: Only GMK67 v2 is VIA, and it passes the layer-tap test.
