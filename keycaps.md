# How to tell if the keycap set you're about to buy has all the keys you need.

If your keybord is US-style (ANSI) 60%, 80% (TKL), or 100% (full size) you probably don't need to care about this because your requirements are met by the default keycaps.

Probably, some layouts (tsangan, minila, split spacebar, split backspace, and especially ISO) have needs for caps that aren't in the default 100% ANSI set that almost all sets are a superset of.

The keycap ad page should include what's called a "Kitting Diagram", with all the keys in the set (kit) laid out and organized by rows. Usually a full set of the default caps, and then below that the non-standard sizes included. If they don't, look for another set that does. Some ads have a photograph of the caps in their shipping box and you have to guess. It can be challenging.

Keycaps themselves are described in terms of the width, in units, so I will be talking about 1u, 1.25u, 1.75u, and so on.

They are also usually described by row number. The diagram may have R0/1 on the bottom or the top. I'm going to count from the top. Some have the top two rows the same (R1/R1), some have special top row keys for the Function row (R0/R1). Similarly the bottom two rows might be R4/R4 or R4/R5.

Some sets are uniform, in which case all the rows are the same shape and you don't have to care about rows.

If the diagram with all the keycaps is numbered from the bottom, just translate.

So, let's say you're buying a keycap set for an _Ajazz AK820 Pro_.

You will need a set that has the following non-default caps:

* R5/1u for ALT, FN, and CTRL (or R4 if there is no R5)
* R4/1.75u for the right shift key
* R3/1u for Page Down
* R0/1u for Delete (or R1 if there is no R0)

If, instead, your board is an ISO 60%, like the _Ranked N60 Nova_ you will need:

* ISO Enter, this is the big 2u tall L-shaped European enter key.
* R3/1u "NUHS" (Non-US hash), has "#~" on a UK keyboard.
* R4/1.25u left shift key
* R4/1u "NUBS" (Non-US backslash), has "\\|" on a UK keyboard.

You will also need other national keycaps. UK has different shifted symbols on grave-accent (next to 1), 1, 2, and 3.  Germany has "QWERTZ" on the top letters row (R2) instead of "QWERTY", france has "AZERTY", and so on. Punctuation and shifted characters are even more complex, and many keys have extra legends on the right side of the keycaps.
