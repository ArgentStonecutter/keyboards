# Layouts for the Y&R6095 "universal" PCB

Since it really only supports Minila and Tsangan it's not really all that universal. :(

Note: These universal hotswap boards have no backlights. With the twisty little maze of extra sockets they have no room for LEDs.

Parts list:

* Y&R 6095 PCB and PC plate https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804503651503.html [^1]
* FEKER plate foam https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805751625106.html
* Gateron screw-in stabilizers https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BZYK3X1S
* Plastic case https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805505986387.html (lower board)

Salt with switches and keycaps to taste. Assemble the PCB/foam/plate with switches on a firm soft surface like a deskpad to support the sockets during installation.

Check for fit before installing the switches: you may need to make small cuts in the foam to access the screws to mount the sandwich in the case. It's OK to cut small segments of the foam out, the switches will stil hold the sandwich together.

You will need a pack of 70 switches. Suggestions:

* Outemu Silent Yellow Jade https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807064676561.html (bottom)
* Redragon A120 Stars https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCTFZPHX (top, but no longer available)
* Kailh Silent Whale https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWF43D5T

Displayed keycaps:

* MOA Black Lotus https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CPWC59NR
* MOA Pastel theme https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CP9D1MSB

Alternate PCBs that may support more layouts:

* YMDK DK61/64/GH60 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805613936725.html ("Color": 2u Shift 64 ANSI ISO)
* DKKB DK6064 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805431959765.html

Disclaimer: I have only tried the first. It confusingly shows up as DK6064 in VIAL, but according to the vendor is not the same board as the DKKB DK6064. You will need to get an appropriate plate for the layout you want (traditional/tsangan/minila/ISO/ANSI/...).

Trying the YMDK DK61 with split backspace. Unfortunately the socket for the split right shift is not installed. The right hand mods are set up for mod-tap using tap-dance in VIAL.

[^1]: No longer available, at least until they do another production run. In the meantime you can use one of the other boards I linked and get a 2u-left-shift 64-key compatible plate. [^2]

[^2]: Update: 5 left at https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804503651503.html and the tri-mode version is available at https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808035664485.html but you have to source your own battery.
