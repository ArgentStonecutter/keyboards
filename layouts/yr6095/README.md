# Layouts for the Y&R6095 "universal" PCB

Since it really only supports Minila and Tsangan it's not really all that universal. :(

Parts list:

* Y&R 6095 PCB and PC plate https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804503651503.html
* FEKER plate foam https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805751625106.html
* Gateron screw-in stabilizers https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BZYK3X1S
* Plastic case https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805505986387.html

Salt with switches and keycaps to taste. Assemble the PCB/foam/plate with switches on a firm soft surface like a deskpad to support the sockets during installation.

Check for fit before installing the switches: you may need to make small cuts in the foam to access the screws to mount the sandwich in the case. It's OK to cut small segments of the foam out, the switches will stil hold the sandwich together.

You will need a pack of 70 switches. Suggestions:

Alternate PCBs:

* YMDK DK61/64/GH60 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805613936725.html ("Color": 2u Shift 64 ANSI ISO)
* DKKB DK6064 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805431959765.html

Disclaimer: I have only tried the first. It confusingly shows up as DK6064 in VIAL, but according to the vendor is not the same board as the DKKB DK6064. You will need to get an appropriate plate.
