To use VIA, open [usevia.app](https://usevia.app/)[^1] in Chrome or Edge

You will need the VIA JSON file for your board, which you should be able to get from the manufacturer's website.

Open VIA, and click on the gear icon to open the SETTINGS tab.

Select the option to enable the design tab.

Click on the paintbrush icon to open the DESIGN tab.

Load the file. If you get error messages toggle the V2 settings option and try again.[^2]

Click the keyboard icon to go back to the CONFIGURE tab.

Click "authorize device" and select your keyboard from the dropdown.

To save or load a layout.json file with your configuration, use the floppy icon on the left to open the "save and load" tab.

If you don't like the results, reverting a typical QMK keyboard is easy. Plug it in holding down the ESC key and it will enter programming mode and clear the "eprom" settings. Unplug it and plug it back in again and it's factory reset.
