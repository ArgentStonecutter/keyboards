# Jamesdonkey J2 experimental firmware

Added a Mac layer and a backlight layer.

Use Fn + right-alt/right-command to switch to Mac layer. This swaps left-alt and left-command and converts right-alt into right-command and back again.

Use Fn-right-control to access the backlight layer.

Use Fn-right-control-page-down to toggle the layer-backlight mode, try it.
