# VIA JSON file for Jamesdonkey J2

The layout.json file `jamesdonkey_j2_ansi_encoder.mac.layout.json` implements a "Mac" layer enabled with Fn-< with an approximation of the Mac F-keys on the Fn layer and swapped CMD/WIN and OPT/ALT.

And I forgot I'd made that, and went and made another one `jamesdonkey_j2_ansi_encoder.winmac.layout.json` - there are probably differences.
