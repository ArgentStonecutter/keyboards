Various keyboard-related resources I want to share.

* [via-boards.md](via-boards.md) contains a list of boards using QMK/VIA/VIAL or VIA emulation.
* [using_via.md](using_via.md) are some quick instructions on using VIA with a VIA JSON file.
* [replacing_switches.md](replacing_switches.md) has some notes on how to safely replace the switches in a prebuilt keyboard.

Also check out https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Keebs/tree/main particularly their [Plumber's Mod](https://github.com/EanNewton/Awesome-Keebs/blob/main/tutorials/Plumbers%20Mod%20for%20Stabilizer.md) page.
